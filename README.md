# Computer Science
## What's inside?
### This repository contains following folders:
1. ASD(Algorithms and Data Structures) - in this folder you can find implementations of structures and algorithms that I was learning on ASD classes on Computer Science study.
2. codefordes - solution to few tasks that I found on http://codeforces.com/ .
3. dailyCoding - tasks from dailyCoding.
4. leetCode - in this folder I'm posting medium and hard problems from https://leetcode.com/ that I'm regularly solving with intent of preparaing to technical interviews. 

## What's the purpose of this repo?
I created this repository with two main intentions. First of all I want to document my progress in learing computer science, with intent of coming back to interesting problems in the future. Secondly, I think such repository can be confirmation of problem solving skills and knowledge in fundamentals of Computer Science during recruitment process.
